                Avani Mitra began with a simple idea: to reconnect people with the food they eat. Founded in 2020, we set out to create a sustainable ecosystem where farmers could thrive while providing consumers with the freshest, most nutritious produce possible.

We're proud to say that every fruit and vegetable in our catalog is grown without harmful chemicals, preserving both your health and the environment.
